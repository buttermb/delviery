# üöÄ NYM Delivery Features - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. üó∫Ô∏è LOCATION TRACKING SYSTEM

#### For Couriers (MANDATORY - ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)
- **Blocking Location Modal**: Couriers cannot access the app without granting location permission
- **Enhanced Permission Modal**:
  - Shows why location is required (nearby orders, navigation, live ETA, delivery proof)
  - Provides step-by-step instructions for iOS and Android
  - "Try Again" button after following instructions
  - Cannot be dismissed until permission is granted
- **Live Location Tracking**: Updates every 10 seconds when courier is online
- **Location Features**:
  - Green checkmark shown when location is active
  - Mandatory for going online
  - Continuous background tracking during deliveries
  - High accuracy GPS positioning

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/courier/LocationPermissionModal.tsx` - Enhanced with blocking UI and instructions
- `src/pages/CourierDashboard.tsx` - Added mandatory location check on app load
- `src/contexts/CourierContext.tsx` - Continuous location tracking every 10 seconds

#### For Customers (OPTIONAL - TODO)
‚è≥ **Pending Implementation**:

### 2. üí∞ COURIER COMMISSION DISPLAY (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)

#### What Couriers Now See:
- **Prominent Earnings Display**: Large, bold earnings amount in teal
- **Breakdown**: Base pay (30% commission) + Tips
- **Hidden from Driver**: Order subtotals, product prices, customer payment amounts
- **Visible to Driver**: 
  - Their commission (e.g., $12.00)
  - Base pay breakdown
  - Expected tip amount
  - Total courier earnings

#### Implementation Details:
- **Active Orders**: Shows `YOUR EARNINGS: $X.XX` with base + tip breakdown
- **Available Orders**: Earnings prominently displayed before acceptance
- **Completed Orders**: Shows courier earnings instead of order total
- **Dashboard Header**: "Your Earnings Today" instead of generic "Today"

**Calculation**: 
```javascript
const baseCommission = orderTotal * 0.30;
const tipAmount = order.tip_amount || 0;
const courierEarnings = baseCommission + tipAmount;
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/CourierDashboard.tsx` - All views updated to show earnings
- Commission rate: 30% (configurable in `CourierContext`)

---

### 3. üì∏ ID SCANNING FEATURE (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - UI READY)

#### Age Verification Scanner Component
- **Barcode Scanner** (UI ready, library integrated):
  - Opens camera to scan ID barcode
  - PDF417 barcode support for US licenses
  - Visual frame overlay for alignment
  - `@zxing/library` package added for production implementation

- **Manual Entry Backup**:
  - Date of birth input field
  - Automatic age calculation
  - Shows age verification result

- **Verification Results**:
  - ‚úÖ **Over 21**: Green checkmark, "Customer is 21+", shows age
  - ‚ùå **Under 21**: Red X, "Customer is UNDER 21", rejection flow

#### Next Steps for Under-21:
- Photo capture of ID (front only) - TODO
- Customer signature collection - TODO
- Complete delivery or return to store flow - TODO
- Incident reporting - TODO

**Files Created**:
- `src/components/courier/AgeVerificationScanner.tsx` - Complete age verification UI
- Integrated with CourierDashboard "Verify ID" step

**Dependencies Added**:
- `@zxing/library` - Barcode scanning for production use

---

### 4. üõí CART SYSTEM (‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING)

#### Current Implementation:
- **Cart Storage**: Uses Supabase database (cart_items table)
- **Cart Display**: 
  - Shows items in slide-out drawer
  - Empty state: "Your cart is empty" with "Browse Products" button
  - Quantity controls (+/- buttons)
  - Remove item (trash icon)
  - Live subtotal calculation
  - Free shipping progress bar
  
#### Cart Features:
- **Persistence**: Saved to Supabase, persists across sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses React Query for instant updates
- **Price Calculations**: 
  - Supports variable weight pricing (3.5g, 7g, 14g, 28g)
  - Handles unit pricing for vapes, edibles
  - Free shipping threshold: $100

**Files**:
- `src/components/CartDrawer.tsx` - Main cart component
- `src/components/FloatingCartButton.tsx` - NEW: Floating cart button (created but not yet integrated)
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Cart icon with item count

#### Cart Logic:
```javascript
// Empty state only shows when cartItems.length === 0
{cartItems.length === 0 ? (
  <EmptyCartMessage />
) : (
  <CartItems />
)}
```

**No "cart is empty" bug found** - Cart correctly checks `cartItems.length` before showing empty state.
