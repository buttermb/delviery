## Task: Fix Token Refresh Race Conditions

### What was done:

1. Created `src/lib/auth/tokenRefreshManager.ts` - A singleton TokenRefreshManager class that:
   - Prevents concurrent refresh requests via promise deduplication (same scope returns same promise)
   - Enforces minimum 5-second interval between refresh attempts to prevent rapid-fire
   - Supports isolated scopes ('tenant-admin', 'customer') so different auth contexts don't interfere
   - Provides `isRefreshing(scope)` check for other code to query refresh state
   - Provides `reset(scope)` and `resetAll()` for cleanup during logout
   - Properly handles errors in the finally block so state is always cleaned up

2. Updated `src/contexts/TenantAdminAuthContext.tsx`:
   - Replaced inline `isRefreshingRef`/`refreshPromiseRef` guards with `tokenRefreshManager.refresh('tenant-admin', ...)`
   - Fixed `verifyToken` which previously did an inline refresh via `resilientFetch` that bypassed the race guard - now delegates to `refreshAuthToken()` which goes through the manager
   - Added guard in `onAuthStateChange` to skip token updates while a managed refresh is in progress (prevents stale tokens from overwriting newer ones)
   - Added `tokenRefreshManager.reset('tenant-admin')` to `clearAuthState` for proper cleanup on logout

3. Updated `src/contexts/CustomerAuthContext.tsx`:
   - Added race condition protection to `refreshToken` using `tokenRefreshManager.refresh('customer', ...)`
   - Previously had no concurrency protection - overlapping interval checks could trigger multiple verifications
   - Added `tokenRefreshManager.reset('customer')` to logout cleanup

4. Updated `src/lib/auth/__tests__/tokenRefresh.test.ts`:
   - Replaced old inline race condition tests with comprehensive tests for the TokenRefreshManager pattern
   - Added tests for: deduplication, scope isolation, error handling, isRefreshing state, minimum interval enforcement, reset behavior
   - All 22 tests pass

5. Fixed pre-existing build error in `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts`:
   - Added missing `sanitizeBasicHtml` export that was referenced by HeroSection.tsx

### Race Conditions Fixed:
- [x] Multiple simultaneous `refreshAuthToken` calls now deduplicated via singleton manager
- [x] `verifyToken` inline refresh no longer bypasses the race guard
- [x] `onAuthStateChange` no longer overwrites tokens during an active refresh
- [x] Customer auth concurrent verify calls now protected
- [x] Minimum interval prevents rapid-fire refresh attempts after errors
- [x] Logout properly resets refresh state to prevent stale attempts
