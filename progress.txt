## Complete Storefront Order Management - Progress

### Completed

#### 1. Created `useStorefrontOrders` Hook (`src/hooks/useStorefrontOrders.ts`)
- Customer order history fetching with TanStack Query
- Order filtering: status (all/active/completed/cancelled), search (order number/item names), date range (7d/30d/90d)
- Order cancellation mutation for pending/confirmed orders
- Order statistics (total orders, active, completed, cancelled, total spent)
- `useStorefrontOrderByToken` for public order tracking
- Auto-refresh every 30s for active orders

#### 2. Created Order Detail Page (`src/pages/shop/OrderDetailPage.tsx`)
- Full order detail view at `/shop/:storeSlug/orders/:orderId`
- Visual status timeline with animated steps (pending → confirmed → preparing → ready → out_for_delivery → delivered)
- Complete order items list with individual "Buy Again" buttons
- Order totals breakdown (subtotal, delivery fee, tax, total)
- Delivery address and customer info sidebar
- Order cancellation flow with confirmation dialog and reason textarea
- Reorder functionality (adds all items back to cart)
- Share/copy tracking URL
- Links to live order tracking page
- Responsive layout (2-column on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Authentication gate (requires customer login)

### Files Changed:
- `src/components/admin/Breadcrumbs.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.tsx` (modified)

## Task: Fix Mobile Navigation Issues

### What was done:

1. **Fixed z-index conflicts between admin mobile nav components**
   - Reduced `MobileBottomNav` (admin) z-index from 100 to 50 to align with design system
   - Removed unused `MobileNav` import from `AdminLayout.tsx` (was imported but never rendered, had conflicting z-index of 50)
   - Removed unused `Input` import from `AdminLayout.tsx`

2. **Fixed LuxuryNav mobile menu overlay positioning**
   - Changed from fixed `top-20` to dynamic `top-16`/`top-20` based on scroll state (nav shrinks on scroll)
   - Added backdrop overlay for dismissing menu by tapping outside
   - Added `maxHeight: calc(100dvh - 5rem)` to prevent content overflow off-screen
   - Improved animation from height-based to y-translate for smoother 60fps transitions

3. **Fixed global `max-width: 100%` CSS rule**
   - Removed overly aggressive `* { max-width: 100% }` that broke tables, carousels, and scrollable content
   - Replaced with scoped `body > #root { max-width: 100vw; overflow-x: hidden }` to contain only the root

4. **Fixed double padding issue in admin layout**
   - Admin `<main>` had both Tailwind `pb-24` AND global CSS `padding-bottom: max(100px, ...)` via `@media`
   - Added `custom-mobile-padding` class to opt out of the global CSS rule
   - Retained Tailwind `pb-24 lg:pb-6` for proper responsive padding

5. **Fixed shop MobileBottomNav safe areas and theme support**
   - Replaced hardcoded `bg-white` with `bg-background/95 backdrop-blur-md` for dark mode support
   - Replaced non-standard `safe-area-pb` class with proper `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` inline style
   - Increased touch targets from 44px to 48px minimum (iOS/Android accessibility guidelines)
   - Added `touch-manipulation` and `active:scale-95` for responsive touch feedback
   - Added proper `aria-label` attributes to navigation links
   - Removed default export (project convention: named exports only)

6. **Added route-change close behavior to all mobile menus**
   - LuxuryNav: Added `useLocation` + `useEffect` to close menu on pathname change
   - ShopLayout (default theme): Added `useLocation` + `useEffect` to close menu on pathname change

7. **Added body scroll lock when mobile menus are open**
   - LuxuryNav: Sets `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` when menu opens
   - ShopLayout (default theme): Same scroll lock pattern
   - Both properly clean up on unmount via effect cleanup

8. **Improved ShopLayout default theme mobile menu accessibility**
   - Added `role="navigation"` and `aria-label` to mobile nav element
   - Increased touch targets to 44px minimum (`min-h-[44px]`, `py-3`)
   - Added `touch-manipulation` and `active:scale-[0.98]` for responsive feedback

9. **Fixed pre-existing build error**
   - Added `sanitizeBasicHtml` export to `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts` (was imported by HeroSection but not exported)

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] Mobile navigation menus close on route change (LuxuryNav, ShopLayout)
- [x] Body scroll is locked when mobile menus are open
- [x] Safe area insets properly handled on all mobile navs (notch/home indicator)
- [x] Touch targets meet 44-48px minimum accessibility guidelines
- [x] Z-index values consistent (50 for bottom nav, no conflicts)
- [x] No hardcoded colors that break dark mode
- [x] LuxuryNav overlay positions correctly relative to nav height on scroll
- [x] Build passes without TypeScript errors

### Files Changed:
- `src/components/admin/MobileBottomNav.tsx` (z-index fix, safe area fix)
- `src/components/shop/MobileBottomNav.tsx` (theme support, safe areas, touch targets, accessibility)
- `src/components/shop/LuxuryNav.tsx` (menu positioning, route-close, scroll lock, backdrop)
- `src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.tsx` (removed unused imports, fixed double padding)
- `src/pages/shop/ShopLayout.tsx` (route-close, scroll lock, touch targets, accessibility)
- `src/index.css` (scoped global max-width rule)
- `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts` (added sanitizeBasicHtml export to fix build)
