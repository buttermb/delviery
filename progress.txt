## Task: Add Breadcrumb Navigation Between Panels

### What was done:
1. Created `src/components/admin/Breadcrumbs.tsx` - A dedicated breadcrumb navigation component that:
   - Shows Home icon linking to Dashboard
   - Parses URL path segments into readable breadcrumb labels
   - Uses a comprehensive SEGMENT_LABELS map for human-readable display names (hubs, pages, etc.)
   - Falls back to Title Case formatting for unknown segments
   - Highlights current page (non-clickable, bold font)
   - All intermediate segments are clickable links for navigation
   - Hides on dashboard (root) since it's unnecessary there
   - Uses proper aria attributes for accessibility

2. Updated `src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.tsx` to:
   - Replace inline breadcrumb logic with the new `Breadcrumbs` component
   - Remove unused imports (Link, useNavigate, ChevronRight)
   - Simplify mobile title display using a local helper function
   - Breadcrumbs now show on all admin pages via the shared layout

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] Breadcrumbs show on all admin pages (via AdminLayout integration)
- [x] Links navigate correctly (each intermediate segment links to proper admin route)
- [x] Current page highlighted (font-medium, text-foreground, non-clickable)

### Files Changed:
- `src/components/admin/Breadcrumbs.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.tsx` (modified)
