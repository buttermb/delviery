## Task: Complete Logout Cleanup

### What was done:

1. Created `src/lib/auth/logoutCleanup.ts` - A centralized logout cleanup utility that:
   - Clears TanStack Query cache (`queryClient.clear()`) to prevent stale data leaking between sessions
   - Destroys client encryption session (keys from memory + session storage)
   - Clears tier-specific localStorage keys (tokens, user data, tenant info)
   - Clears shared session keys (`floraiq_user_id`, `lastTenantSlug`) from both localStorage and sessionStorage
   - Provides `broadcastLogout()` helper for cross-tab synchronization
   - Supports all 5 auth tiers: super_admin, tenant_admin, customer, vendor, base

2. Updated `src/contexts/TenantAdminAuthContext.tsx`:
   - Added `useQueryClient` hook and `performLogoutCleanup` import
   - Replaced manual cleanup in `logout()` with centralized `performLogoutCleanup()`
   - Updated cross-tab logout handler to also clear query cache via `performLogoutCleanup()`
   - Replaced inline BroadcastChannel code with `broadcastLogout()` helper

3. Updated `src/contexts/SuperAdminAuthContext.tsx`:
   - Added `useQueryClient` hook and `performLogoutCleanup` import
   - Replaced manual encryption destroy + storage cleanup with `performLogoutCleanup()`
   - Fixed duplicate `safeStorage.removeItem('floraiq_user_id')` call
   - Now properly clears query cache on logout

4. Updated `src/contexts/CustomerAuthContext.tsx`:
   - Added `useQueryClient` hook and `performLogoutCleanup` import
   - Replaced manual encryption destroy + storage cleanup with `performLogoutCleanup()`
   - Customer-specific keys (cart, checkout data, customer mode) now properly cleared
   - Fixed duplicate `safeStorage.removeItem('floraiq_user_id')` call

5. Updated `src/contexts/VendorAuthContext.tsx`:
   - Added `useQueryClient` hook, `performLogoutCleanup` import
   - Added try/catch error handling around `supabase.auth.signOut()`
   - Added encryption session destruction (was completely missing)
   - Added query cache clearing (was completely missing)
   - Added storage cleanup (was completely missing)

6. Updated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
   - Added `useQueryClient` hook and `performLogoutCleanup` import
   - Replaced manual `clientEncryption.destroy()` + storage removal with `performLogoutCleanup()`
   - Now properly clears query cache on sign out

7. Fixed pre-existing build error in `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts`:
   - Added missing `sanitizeBasicHtml` export (used by HeroSection but was never defined)

### Key Improvements:
- **Query cache clearing**: All auth contexts now clear the TanStack Query cache on logout, preventing stale data from a previous session showing up when a different user logs in
- **Consistent cleanup**: All 5 auth tiers use the same centralized cleanup logic
- **VendorAuthContext hardened**: Was previously missing encryption destroy, storage cleanup, error handling, and query cache clearing
- **Reduced duplication**: Removed duplicate storage removal calls and inline cleanup code
- **Cross-tab logout**: BroadcastChannel logic extracted to reusable `broadcastLogout()` helper

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] All auth contexts clear TanStack Query cache on logout
- [x] Encryption sessions destroyed consistently across all tiers
- [x] Storage keys cleaned up per tier (tokens, user data, tenant info)
- [x] Shared session keys cleared (floraiq_user_id, lastTenantSlug)
- [x] Cross-tab logout synchronization maintained
- [x] VendorAuthContext brought to parity with other auth contexts
- [x] Build passes with no TypeScript errors
