# Progress: Fix Remaining Type Mismatches Across Codebase

## Completed

### Missing `sanitize` utility module (build-breaking)
- **Problem**: `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts` was imported by `ProductDetailPage.tsx` and `CustomHTMLSection.tsx` but did not exist, causing the production build to fail with `ENOENT: no such file or directory`.
- **Fix**: Created `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts` which exports `sanitizeHtml()` using the already-installed `dompurify` package.
- **Files created**: `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts`

### TypeScript type checking
- Ran `tsc --noEmit` — zero type errors across the entire codebase.
- Ran `npm run build` — production build succeeds.
- Ran ESLint on the new file — no lint issues.

## Summary
The codebase had one build-breaking missing module (`@/lib/utils/sanitize`). After creating it, both `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` pass cleanly with no type mismatches.
