# FloraIQ Interconnectivity Build — Progress Log
# Ralph Wiggum appends learnings here each iteration

## task-001: Create shared event bus utility
- Created `src/lib/eventBus.ts` with typed publish/subscribe pattern
- Used TypeScript generics (`EventPayloads` interface) to type all event payloads
- Events: order_created, order_updated, inventory_changed, customer_updated, product_updated, storefront_synced, menu_published, notification_sent
- Exported `subscribe`, `publish`, `unsubscribe`, `getSubscriberCount`, `clearAllSubscriptions`
- Internal storage uses `Map<string, Set<callback>>` as specified
- Added `logger.debug` calls for subscribe, unsubscribe, and publish operations
- No console.log used — all logging via `@/lib/logger`
- Subscribe returns unsubscribe function for convenient cleanup
- Error handling in publish prevents one handler failure from affecting others

## task-002: Create useEventBus hook
- Created `src/hooks/useEventBus.ts` as React hook wrapper around eventBus
- Main `useEventBus<T>` hook accepts eventName and callback, auto-unsubscribes on unmount
- Used `useRef` to keep callback stable and avoid re-subscribing on every render
- Returns `{ publish }` function typed to the specific event payload
- Added `useEventPublisher` helper for components that only emit events (no subscription)
- Added `useMultiEventBus` for subscribing to multiple events at once
- All logging uses `logger` from `@/lib/logger` — no console.log
- Proper useEffect cleanup returns unsubscribe function
- Imports use `@/` alias as required
