## Task: Complete StorefrontGiftCards Implementation

### What was done:

1. **Rewrote `src/pages/admin/storefront/StorefrontGiftCards.tsx`** - Complete admin page that:
   - Uses `useTenantAdminAuth()` for proper tenant context (fixed from incorrect `useTenant()`)
   - Fetches the `marketplace_stores` record by `tenant_id` to get the correct `store_id`
   - Shows loading skeleton while store loads
   - Composes the GiftCardTable, GiftCardBalanceCheck, and StorefrontGiftCardManager components
   - Supports viewing transaction history for individual cards (ledger view)
   - Responsive grid layout with table on left (3/4) and balance check on right (1/4)

2. **Created `src/components/admin/storefront/GiftCardTable.tsx`** - Full data table with:
   - Query for all gift cards from `marketplace_gift_cards` table filtered by `store_id`
   - Search by code, email, or recipient name
   - Status filter (All, Active, Disabled, Depleted)
   - Checkbox-based bulk selection with select-all
   - Bulk actions: Deactivate and Activate cards (with confirmation dialog)
   - Columns: Code (with copy button), Recipient, Balance, Status, Created, Expires, Actions
   - Pagination via `usePagination` hook with `StandardPagination` component
   - Summary stats in card description (total cards, active, depleted, outstanding balance)
   - Empty state with contextual messaging
   - View transaction history button per card row

3. **Created `src/components/admin/storefront/GiftCardLedger.tsx`** - Transaction history view:
   - Queries `marketplace_gift_card_ledger` table for a specific card
   - Shows all transactions: Issue, Use, Adjustment, Refund, Reload
   - Color-coded amounts (green for credits, red for debits)
   - Transaction type badges with distinct colors
   - Directional icons (TrendingUp/TrendingDown)
   - Balance-after column showing running balance
   - Back navigation button to return to main table
   - Card info in header (code, recipient, current/initial balance)

4. **Created `src/components/admin/storefront/GiftCardBalanceCheck.tsx`** - Quick balance lookup:
   - Input field for gift card code (auto-uppercased)
   - Calls `validate_marketplace_gift_card` RPC for validation
   - Shows balance and validity status with appropriate badges
   - Error handling for invalid/disabled/depleted cards
   - Enter key support for quick lookup

5. **Rewrote `src/components/admin/storefront/StorefrontGiftCardManager.tsx`** - Issue dialog:
   - Preset amount buttons ($25, $50, $100, $250) for quick selection
   - Custom amount input with proper validation
   - Recipient email and name fields
   - Custom code input (auto-uppercased, font-mono)
   - Internal notes field
   - Loading state with spinner on submit button
   - Uses `issue_marketplace_gift_card` RPC
   - Proper error handling with logger and toast

6. **Fixed pre-existing build error** in `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts`:
   - Added `sanitizeBasicHtml` export alias (was imported by HeroSection but not exported)

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] Can create gift cards with custom amounts (preset $25/$50/$100/$250 + custom)
- [x] Can search and manage existing gift cards in table (search by code/email/name)
- [x] Balance displays correctly (current balance with "of initial" when partially used)
- [x] Gift card status updates (active/disabled/depleted with color-coded badges)
- [x] Bulk actions (deactivate/activate multiple cards)
- [x] Filter by status (all/active/disabled/depleted)
- [x] Balance check functionality (quick code lookup via RPC)
- [x] Redemption history view per card (full ledger with transaction types)

### Files Changed:
- `src/pages/admin/storefront/StorefrontGiftCards.tsx` (rewritten)
- `src/components/admin/storefront/StorefrontGiftCardManager.tsx` (rewritten)
- `src/components/admin/storefront/GiftCardTable.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/admin/storefront/GiftCardLedger.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/admin/storefront/GiftCardBalanceCheck.tsx` (new)
- `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts` (fix pre-existing missing export)

### Build Status:
- `npm run build` passes with no errors
