## Enhance Disposable Menu Analytics Dashboard - COMPLETED

### What was done:

1. **Created `useMenuDashboardAnalytics` hook** (`src/hooks/useMenuDashboardAnalytics.ts`)
   - Fetches tenant-wide analytics data (menus, access logs, orders)
   - Computes comprehensive MenuDashboardAnalytics with 15+ metrics
   - Real-time subscription to `menu_access_logs` and `menu_orders` tables via Supabase channels
   - Provides `getExportData()` for CSV/Excel export
   - Includes `refresh()` function that resets realtime counters and refetches data
   - Proper cleanup on unmount (removes Supabase channel)

2. **Created `MenuAnalyticsDashboard` component** (`src/components/admin/disposable-menus/MenuAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`)
   - **8 stat cards**: Total Menus, Active Menus, Burned Menus, Total Views, Total Orders, Revenue, Conversion Rate, Avg Time to First View
   - **Views Over Time chart** (area chart, last 14 days)
   - **Orders & Revenue chart** (dual-axis line chart)
   - **Menu Status donut chart** (active vs soft-burned vs hard-burned vs expired)
   - **Burn Reasons pie chart** (breakdown of why menus were burned)
   - **Conversion Funnel** (views → unique visitors → orders placed → completed)
   - **Peak Access Hours** bar chart (24-hour distribution)
   - **Top Products by Revenue** (ranked list with progress bars)
   - **Key Insights summary** card with auto-generated insights
   - Live activity badge showing real-time view/order counts
   - Export button (CSV/Excel/JSON) using existing AnalyticsExportButton component
   - Loading skeletons and empty states for all sections

3. **Added Analytics tab to SmartDashboard** (`src/components/admin/disposable-menus/SmartDashboard.tsx`)
   - New "Analytics" tab (4th tab between Orders and Setup)
   - Lazy-loaded for performance (code-split)
   - Suspense boundary with skeleton loading state
   - Responsive tab labels (icon-only on mobile)

4. **Fixed pre-existing build issue** (`src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts`)
   - Created missing `sanitizeHtml` utility using DOMPurify
   - Fixes build failure from unresolved import in ProductDetailPage and CustomHTMLSection

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- All stats display correctly (8 key metrics)
- Charts render with real data (5 chart types)
- Real-time updates work (Supabase channel subscriptions for live view/order counts)
- CSV/Excel/JSON export option available via AnalyticsExportButton

### Build Status: PASSING
