## Task: Add Input Sanitization for All Forms

### What was done:
1. Enhanced `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts` with comprehensive form sanitization functions:
   - `sanitizeFormInput()` - For plain text inputs (trims, removes HTML, encodes angle brackets, enforces max length)
   - `sanitizeBasicHtml()` - For rendering simple rich text (allows only b/i/em/strong/u/br/span/p tags)
   - `sanitizeEmail()` - Trims, lowercases, removes dangerous characters
   - `sanitizeNumericInput()` - Only allows digits, decimal, minus
   - `sanitizePhoneInput()` - Only allows phone-valid characters
   - `sanitizeUrlInput()` - Blocks dangerous URL schemes (javascript:, data:, vbscript:)
   - `sanitizeSlugInput()` - Only allows lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores
   - `sanitizeTextareaInput()` - Like sanitizeFormInput but preserves newlines, normalizes excessive breaks
   - `sanitizeCouponCode()` - Only uppercase alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores
   - `sanitizeSkuInput()` - Uppercase alphanumeric and hyphens
   - `sanitizePriceInput()` - Only digits and single decimal point
   - `sanitizeFormData()` - Generic helper to sanitize all string fields in a form data object

2. Applied sanitization to 17 form components at point of submission:

   **Admin Forms:**
   - `AppointmentForm.tsx` - customer_id, notes
   - `CouponCreateForm.tsx` - code, description
   - `SupplierForm.tsx` - supplier_name, contact_person, email, phone, address, payment_terms
   - `ProductForm.tsx` - name, sku, vendor_name, strain_name, batch_number, description, metrc_retail_id
   - `TicketForm.tsx` - subject, description
   - `RecallForm.tsx` - batch_number, product_name, reason
   - `POCreateForm.tsx` - notes
   - `RACreateForm.tsx` - product_name, notes
   - `CustomIntegrationForm.tsx` - name, endpoint_url, description

   **Admin Dialogs:**
   - `CreateClientDialog.tsx` - business_name, contact_name, email, phone, address, notes
   - `EditClientDialog.tsx` - business_name, contact_name, email, phone, address, notes
   - `CreateTenantDialog.tsx` - business_name, owner_email, owner_name, phone
   - `AddCourierDialog.tsx` - full_name, email, phone, license_number, vehicle fields
   - `PaymentDialog.tsx` - reference_number, notes
   - `CreateMenuDialog.tsx` - name, description, geofence_location, custom_message

   **Storefront Forms:**
   - `SinglePageCheckout.tsx` - firstName, lastName, email, phone, street, apartment, city, state, zip, deliveryNotes
   - `ReviewForm.tsx` - customer_name, customer_email, title, comment
   - `ReviewSubmissionForm.tsx` - customer_name, title, content
   - `EmailCaptureSection.tsx` - email

### Sanitization Strategy:
- Sanitization is applied at the point of form submission (not onChange) to avoid interfering with user typing
- Each field uses the appropriate sanitizer based on its data type (email, phone, URL, text, textarea, etc.)
- All sanitizers enforce maximum length limits to prevent oversized input attacks
- HTML tags are stripped from text inputs, dangerous URL schemes are blocked
- XSS vectors (script injection, event handlers, javascript: URLs) are neutralized

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] All form inputs are sanitized before being sent to database/API
- [x] Different sanitization strategies for different input types (email, phone, text, textarea, URL, etc.)
- [x] Protection against XSS, script injection, and HTML injection
- [x] Maximum length enforcement on all inputs
- [x] Build passes with no TypeScript errors
- [x] Existing form validation logic preserved (sanitization is additive)

### Files Changed:
- `src/lib/utils/sanitize.ts` (rewritten - comprehensive sanitization utilities)
- `src/components/admin/appointments/AppointmentForm.tsx` (sanitization added)
- `src/components/admin/coupons/CouponCreateForm.tsx` (sanitization added)

- `src/components/EmailCaptureSection.tsx` (sanitization added)

## Task: Add Breadcrumb Navigation Between Panels

### What was done:
1. Created `src/components/admin/Breadcrumbs.tsx` - A dedicated breadcrumb navigation component that:
   - Shows Home icon linking to Dashboard
   - Parses URL path segments into readable breadcrumb labels
   - Uses a comprehensive SEGMENT_LABELS map for human-readable display names (hubs, pages, etc.)
   - Falls back to Title Case formatting for unknown segments
   - Highlights current page (non-clickable, bold font)
   - All intermediate segments are clickable links for navigation
   - Hides on dashboard (root) since it's unnecessary there
   - Uses proper aria attributes for accessibility

2. Updated `src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.tsx` to:
   - Replace inline breadcrumb logic with the new `Breadcrumbs` component
   - Remove unused imports (Link, useNavigate, ChevronRight)
   - Simplify mobile title display using a local helper function
   - Breadcrumbs now show on all admin pages via the shared layout

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] Breadcrumbs show on all admin pages (via AdminLayout integration)
- [x] Links navigate correctly (each intermediate segment links to proper admin route)
- [x] Current page highlighted (font-medium, text-foreground, non-clickable)

### Files Changed:
- `src/components/admin/Breadcrumbs.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.tsx` (modified)
