## 💡 Tips for Maximum Performance

1. **Add images to all products** - Even simple images boost conversion
2. **Use high-quality photos** - Professional appearance matters
3. **Show multiple angles** - Upload to `images[]` array
4. **Monitor analytics** - Check which images perform best
5. **Update regularly** - Keep product images fresh

## 🎨 Customization

### Appearance Settings
Control in menu creation:
- `show_product_images`: Enable/disable images
- `show_availability`: Show stock levels
- Custom styling via appearance settings

### Security
- Screenshot protection (optional)
- Image watermarks (future enhancement)
- Device-specific access tracking

## 📝 Database Schema

```sql
-- Products already support images
CREATE TABLE wholesale_inventory (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name TEXT,
  image_url TEXT,          -- Primary image
  images TEXT[],           -- Additional images
  ...
);

-- Menu products inherit images
-- Edge function passes through automatically
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Images stored in Supabase storage
- Public URLs (menu is already secure via token)
- Access logged per customer
- Zoom events tracked for insights
- Screenshot protection available (menu-wide)

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Track in Analytics → Images:
- ✅ Image coverage %
- ✅ Views and zooms
- ✅ Conversion rate
- ✅ Per-product performance
- ✅ Revenue by image quality
