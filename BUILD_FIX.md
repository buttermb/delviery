# Build Error Fix

## Issue
There was a build error related to icon rendering in `RoleBasedSidebar.tsx`. The issue was with how Lucide icon components were being rendered dynamically.

## Solution
Changed from using a `renderIcon` helper function to inline IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that extracts the icon component before rendering:

```typescript
// Before (caused build error):
{renderIcon(item.icon, item.iconSize || 'h-5 w-5')}

// After (working):
{(() => {
  const Icon = item.icon;
  return <Icon className={item.iconSize || 'h-5 w-5'} />;
})()}
```

This pattern properly handles dynamic component rendering in the build system.

## Status
âœ… Fixed - Icons now render correctly in the sidebar navigation
