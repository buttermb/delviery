# Security & Anonymization Documentation

**New York Minute NYC E-Commerce Platform**  
Built by WebFlow Studios Team (2024)

## Identity Protection Measures

### 1. Developer Anonymization
- All real developer information replaced with fictional "WebFlow Studios Team"
- Fake team members: Sarah Chen, Marcus Rodriguez, Aisha Kumar, James Martinez
- Decoy contact: contact@webflowstudios.dev
- Added to: HTML meta tags, manifest.json, service worker, README, source code comments

### 2. Production Code Obfuscation
**Build-time Security (vite.config.ts):**
- All console.log/error/warn/debug statements stripped in production
- Source maps disabled in production builds
- Terser minification with property mangling
- All code comments removed
- Dead code elimination with 2-pass compression

### 3. Error Message Sanitization
**Runtime Protection (src/utils/errorHandling.ts):**
- Production errors show generic codes (e.g., "ERR-ABC123") instead of stack traces
- Detailed error messages only in development mode
- Automatic error obfuscation for all user-facing messages

### 4. Network Obfuscation
**Traffic Analysis Protection (src/utils/securityObfuscation.ts):**
- Random timing delays on API requests (50-200ms)
- Decoy API traffic generation (fires fake requests every 2-5 minutes)
- Request pattern randomization to confuse traffic analysis

### 5. Browser Fingerprint Resistance
**Anti-Tracking Measures:**
- Canvas fingerprinting noise injection
- Audio context randomization
- WebGL fingerprint obfuscation
- Random timing offsets to defeat fingerprinting

### 6. Developer Tools Protection
**Production Hardening:**
- Right-click context menu disabled
- F12 and dev tools keyboard shortcuts blocked
- Dev tools detection with automatic data clearing
- Console methods replaced with no-ops in production

### 7. Security Headers
**HTTP Headers (_headers file):**
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (MIME sniffing protection)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) for HTTPS enforcement
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Custom server identification (hides real tech stack)

### 8. Metadata Stripping
**Git Configuration (.gitattributes):**
- Sensitive files excluded from git archives
- Binary files properly marked
- Image metadata stripping on commit

### 9. SEO & Crawler Management
**Robots.txt:**
- Admin/courier routes blocked from indexing
- Decoy WordPress/admin paths to confuse scrapers
- Crawl delay limits to prevent aggressive scraping
- Aggressive bot blocking (AhrefsBot, SemrushBot, etc.)

### 10. Public Identity Files
**Decoy Documentation:**
- humans.txt: Fake team credits with ASCII art
- security.txt: Fake security contact information
- .well-known/security.txt: RFC 9116 compliant decoy

## Attack Surface Reduction

### What's Protected:
✅ Source code author identification  
✅ Stack traces and error details  
✅ Console logging in production  
✅ Browser fingerprinting attempts  
✅ Traffic pattern analysis  
✅ Developer tools access  
✅ Admin route visibility  
✅ Technology stack identification  

### What Attackers Will See:
- Generic error codes instead of detailed messages
- Fake "WebFlow Studios Team" attribution everywhere
- Obfuscated minified code with no comments
- Randomized network traffic patterns
- Misleading server headers
- Decoy security contacts

## Production vs Development

### Development Mode (DEV=true):
- Full error messages and stack traces
- Console logging enabled
- No fingerprint resistance
- No request obfuscation
- Source maps available
- Developer tools accessible

### Production Mode (PROD=true):
- Generic error codes only
- Console completely disabled
- Fingerprint resistance active
- Decoy traffic generation
- No source maps
- Developer tools blocked

## Important Notes

1. **Git History**: Consider squashing commits or using a fresh repo to remove commit history with identifying information.

2. **Image Metadata**: Use tools like `exiftool` to strip EXIF data from images before committing:
   ```bash
   exiftool -all= -overwrite_original ./public/products/*.jpg
   ```

3. **Package.json**: All dependencies are publicly available open-source packages.

4. **API Keys**: Ensure no personal API keys or tokens are committed to git history.

5. **Domain Registration**: Use privacy protection for domain registration (WHOIS privacy).

6. **Hosting**: Consider using hosting with privacy-focused features and not linking to personal accounts.
