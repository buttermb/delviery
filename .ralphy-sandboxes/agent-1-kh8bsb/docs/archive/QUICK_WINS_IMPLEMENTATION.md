## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STARTING POINT

Based on your answers, I recommend starting with these **QUICK WINS** that can be done immediately:

### 1. **Inventory Restoration on Cancel** (1 day) ⚡
- **Impact:** HIGH - Critical for order management
- **Complexity:** LOW - Simple database trigger
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (verified)

### 2. **Tenant Suspension Enforcement** (1 day) ⚡
- **Impact:** HIGH - Security critical
- **Complexity:** LOW - RLS policy updates
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL

### 3. **Super Admin Impersonation** (1-2 days) ⚡
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Support efficiency
- **Complexity:** MEDIUM - Edge function needed
- **Status:** ⚠️ UI EXISTS, FUNCTION NEEDED
