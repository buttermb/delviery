## FAQ

**Q: What happens if a customer shares the link?**
A: You can set a "View Limit" per customer. If shared too widely, our Velocity Detection will block access or burn the menu.

**Q: Can I recover a burned menu?**
A: No. Once burned, it is permanently deleted for security. You must create a new one.
