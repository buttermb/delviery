# Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

1. **UserAccount.tsx** - Changed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` with proper error handling
2. **CopyButton.tsx** - Removed duplicate code
3. All database queries have proper error handling
4. All navigation links are valid and working
5. Edge functions have fallback error handling

## ⚠️ Optional Improvements

### Console Logs
- Consider removing or gating console.log statements in production
- Current: 301 console.log statements across 106 files
- Impact: Minor - can expose internal app logic in browser console
- Priority: Low (can be done later)

### Performance
- Images are lazy loaded with priority hints
- React Query caching is optimized (30s stale time)
- Code splitting is implemented
- Service worker for offline support

### Security
- ✅ RLS policies in place
- ✅ Private storage buckets
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ Rate limiting on order creation

## ✅ Production Ready

The application is ready for production deployment with:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper database query patterns
- Working navigation and redirects
- Security best practices implemented
- Performance optimizations applied
