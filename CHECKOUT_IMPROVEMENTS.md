# Checkout Page Improvements

## Date: October 28, 2025

## Summary
Enhanced the checkout page with mandatory checkbox confirmations, improved visual feedback, haptic feedback, localStorage persistence, and better mobile optimization.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Mandatory Legal Confirmations**
- **Added 3 required checkboxes** that users must actively click to accept:
  - **Age Verification**: Users must confirm they are 21+ with valid ID
  - **Legal Compliance**: Users understand hemp product laws and drug testing implications
  - **Terms & Conditions**: Users agree to sale terms, delivery policy, and refund policy

### 2. **Visual Improvements**
- Replaced basic HTML checkboxes with styled UI Checkbox components from shadcn/ui
- Added **dynamic background colors** that change when each checkbox is checked
- Added **progress indicator** showing "X / 3 completed" with visual progress bars
- Enhanced button text that changes based on completion status:
  - Shows "Accept All Terms to Continue" when checkboxes not completed
  - Shows "Place Order" when all checkboxes are accepted

### 3. **Haptic Feedback** (NEW)
- Added tactile feedback for all checkbox interactions using `useHapticFeedback` hook
- Light vibration for checkbox selections
- Success vibration when order is placed successfully
- Error vibration for validation errors and failed order submission
- Provides native mobile app-like experience

### 4. **localStorage Persistence** (NEW)
- Guest checkout information is now automatically saved to localStorage
- Returns for guest users have prefilled name, phone, and email
- Information is saved in real-time as users type
- Improves conversion rates and reduces friction

### 5. **Validation & UX**
- Order placement is **blocked** until all 3 checkboxes are checked
- Clear error messages for each missing confirmation with haptic feedback:
  - "Please confirm you are 21+ to proceed" + vibration
  - "Please accept the legal terms to proceed" + vibration
  - "Please accept the terms and conditions to proceed" + vibration
- Button is **disabled** until all confirmations are accepted

### 6. **Enhanced Messaging**
- Added **bold labels** (Age Verification Required, Legal Compliance, Terms & Conditions) to make each section clear
- More detailed descriptions of what users are agreeing to
- Better wording about courier age verification process

### 7. **Mobile Optimization**
- Larger touch targets for all checkboxes (minimum 44x44px)
- Better spacing and padding for mobile interaction
- Improved text leading for readability on small screens
- Visual progress indicator works well on all screen sizes
- Haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation of actions

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [ageConfirmed, setAgeConfirmed] = useState(false);
const [legalConfirmed, setLegalConfirmed] = useState(false);
const [termsConfirmed, setTermsConfirmed] = useState(false);
```

### Validation Logic
```typescript
if (!ageConfirmed) {
  toast.error("Please confirm you are 21+ to proceed");
  return;
}

if (!legalConfirmed) {
  toast.error("Please accept the legal terms to proceed");
  return;
}

if (!termsConfirmed) {
  toast.error("Please accept the terms and conditions to proceed");
  return;
}
```

### Visual Feedback
- Unchecked: `bg-muted/50 border-muted` (gray background)
- Checked: `bg-primary/5 border-primary/30` (primary color with highlight)
- Progress bar: Shows individual checkbox completion status

## Benefits

1. **Legal Protection**: Explicit consent for age, legal compliance, and terms
2. **Reduced Cart Abandonment**: Clear progress indicator encourages completion
3. **Better UX**: Visual feedback shows users exactly what's needed
4. **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for age-restricted sales
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Touch-optimized checkboxes and improved spacing
6. **Faster Checkout**: localStorage persistence saves guest information for returns
7. **Native Feel**: Haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation

## Technical Implementation

### localStorage Persistence
```typescript
// Load saved guest info on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('guest_checkout_info');
    if (saved) {
      const data = JSON.parse(saved);
      setGuestName(data.name || "");
      setGuestPhone(data.phone || "");
      setGuestEmail(data.email || "");
    }
  }
}, [user]);

// Save guest info as user types
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user && (guestName || guestPhone || guestEmail)) {
    localStorage.setItem('guest_checkout_info', JSON.stringify({
      name: guestName,
      phone: guestPhone,
      email: guestEmail
    }));
  }
}, [guestName, guestPhone, guestEmail, user]);
```

### Haptic Feedback Integration
```typescript
import { useHapticFeedback } from "@/hooks/useHapticFeedback";

const { triggerSelection, triggerSuccess, triggerError } = useHapticFeedback();

// Checkbox interactions
onCheckedChange={(checked) => {
  triggerSelection();
  setAgeConfirmed(checked as boolean);
}}

// Error handling
if (!ageConfirmed) {
  triggerError();
  toast.error("Please confirm you are 21+ to proceed");
}

// Success
triggerSuccess();
toast.success("Order placed successfully!");
```
